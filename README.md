# fullstackopen-part2

This repository contains my solutions for Part 2 of the [Fullstack Open 2025](https://fullstackopen.com/) course. Part 2 focuses on introducing more advanced features of React, including forms, RESTful APIs, and modularization.

## Exercises

Each folder contains code for a specific exercise or exercise set:

- `part2a/` – Course Information (exercises 2.1–2.5)
- `part2b/` – Phonebook (exercises 2.6–2.10)
- `part2c/` – Data for countries (exercises 2.11–2.14)

Exercise solutions are inside each respective folder.

## Running the Exercises

1. Navigate to the exercise folder you want to run, for example:

    ```bash
    cd part2a
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. The app should be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) depending on your setup.

## Notes

- Each exercise is a separate React app created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- See the comments in each folder for more details about the solution.
